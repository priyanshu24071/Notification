Overview

Welcome to our Notification System! This system is designed to facilitate the delivery of notifications through various channels such as push notifications, SMS, and email. This README will guide you through the system's architecture, components, and how to use it effectively.

Approach

Our notification system follows a modular design approach, allowing flexibility and scalability. At the heart of the system lies the Notification Service, which orchestrates the delivery of notifications through different channels. Each notification channel (Push Notifications, SMS, Email) is implemented as a separate module.

Usage

To use the notification system:

Initialize the Notification Service.
Create a notification object with the desired content.

Call the send method of the Notification Service, passing the notification object.

// Example Usage

const NotificationService = require('./notificationService');

// Initialize notification service

const notifier = new NotificationService();

// Create a notification

const notification = {
  title: 'New Message',
  message: 'You have a new message!'
};

// Send notification

notifier.send(notification);


Testing

Unit Testing: Write unit tests for each notification channel module to ensure they send notifications correctly.
Integration Testing: Write integration tests for the Notification Service to ensure notifications are delivered through all channels.
End-to-End Testing: Simulate real-world scenarios to test the entire notification flow.
Conclusion

Our Notification System provides a flexible and modular approach to delivering notifications through multiple channels. By following the guidelines in this README, you can effectively integrate and utilize the system in your applications.
